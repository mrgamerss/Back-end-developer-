## 🟢 Beginner Level  
### 1. Robust CRUD API with Advanced Filtering & Pagination  
- **Problem:** A basic REST API returns all records at once, leading to slow responses as your dataset grows.  
- **Solution:**  
  - Implement cursor‑ or offset‑based pagination (limit/offset or keyset pagination).  
  - Add dynamic query parameters for filtering (e.g. `?status=active&createdAfter=2025‑01‑01`).  
  - Ensure you index your database columns to keep those queries snappy.  
- **Stand‑out Factor:** A seamless, responsive list endpoint that scales from dozens to millions of items.  

### 2. Secure File Uploads with Streaming & Virus‑Scanning  
- **Problem:** Naïve uploads load entire files into memory, risking crashes and security holes.  
- **Solution:**  
  - Use Node.js streams to pipe incoming file chunks directly to disk or object storage (e.g. S3).  
  - Integrate an antivirus scanner (ClamAV) in the streaming pipeline.  
  - Generate and store thumbnails on‑the‑fly for images.  
- **Stand‑out Factor:** An upload service that never OOMs, quarantines threats, and delivers previews instantly.  

### 3. JWT Authentication with Role‑Based Access Control  
- **Problem:** All authenticated users can access every endpoint, creating security risks.  
- **Solution:**  
  - Issue JSON Web Tokens with embedded roles/permissions.  
  - Build a middleware layer that verifies token, extracts roles, and gates endpoints (e.g. admin-only routes).  
  - Refresh tokens safely using rotating refresh‐token patterns.  
- **Stand‑out Factor:** A rock‑solid auth system that feels like a plug‑and‑play security layer.

## 🟡 Intermediate Level  
### 1. Distributed Caching & Cache Invalidation  
- **Problem:** Hitting your database for every request under load leads to high latency.  
- **Solution:**  
  - Introduce Redis/Memcached as a centralized cache.  
  - Implement cache‑aside pattern: check cache first, fallback to DB, then repopulate cache.  
  - Design fine‑grained invalidation (e.g. publish/subscribe to invalidate related keys on data change).  
- **Stand‑out Factor:** Sub‑50ms responses under sustained traffic spikes.  

### 2. Background Job Queue for Heavy Tasks  
- **Problem:** Generating reports or sending bulk emails during the request leads to timeouts.  
- **Solution:**  
  - Use a queue library (Bull, Bee-Queue, or RabbitMQ) to offload heavy work.  
  - Build a worker process that retries on failure, honors rate limits, and logs progress.  
  - Expose a “job status” endpoint so clients can poll or subscribe via WebSocket for updates.  
- **Stand‑out Factor:** Your API stays fast, while long‑running jobs complete reliably in the background.  

### 3. Transactional Workflows with the Saga Pattern  
- **Problem:** Orchestrating data consistency across multiple microservices (e.g., order service + payment service).  
- **Solution:**  
  - Implement the Saga pattern: split a business transaction into a series of local transactions with compensating steps on failure.  
  - Use an orchestration service or choreography via event bus (Kafka/RabbitMQ).  
  - Ensure idempotency and clear rollback logic.  
- **Stand‑out Factor:** Complex workflows that remain consistent even when individual services fail.

## 🔴 Expert Level  
### 1. Multi‑Tenant Architecture with Dynamic Sharding  
- **Problem:** Serving multiple clients from the same database risks data leaks and performance bottlenecks.  
- **Solution:**  
  - Architect tenant isolation at the database layer: separate schemas or entirely separate clusters per tenant.  
  - Automate tenant provisioning with infrastructure‑as‑code (Terraform, AWS CDK).  
  - Implement connection pooling and routing logic in your API gateway or service.  
- **Stand‑out Factor:** A backend that can onboard new tenants in minutes, each with guaranteed isolation and performance SLAs.  

### 2. End‑to‑End Observability & Distributed Tracing  
- **Problem:** When a request traverses 10+ microservices, pinpointing latency or root cause is like finding a needle in a haystack.  
- **Solution:**  
  - Instrument services with OpenTelemetry (or Jaeger) to propagate trace IDs.  
  - Collect metrics (Prometheus) and logs (ELK or Loki) in a centralized observability stack.  
  - Build dashboards and alerts that tie a single user request across all services.  
- **Stand‑out Factor:** Ability to debug production incidents in real time, and continuously optimize tail‑latency.  

### 3. Event‑Driven Platform with Exactly‑Once Semantics  
- **Problem:** Duplicate or lost messages in high‑throughput event streams can corrupt your data.  
- **Solution:**  
  - Use Kafka (or Pulsar) with idempotent producers and transactional consumers.  
  - Design your consumers to store processed event IDs and skip duplicates.  
  - Implement “dead‑letter” handling for unrecoverable messages.  
- **Stand‑out Factor:** A bulletproof event pipeline where every business event is processed exactly once—even at millions of events per minute.
